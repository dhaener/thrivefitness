| Installation: DrupalGap + PhoneGap + jQueryMobile = Android |
|=============================================================|

0. Enable the DrupalGap Module on your Drupal Site

1. Complete the PhoneGap Getting Started Guide for Android

   http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html

2. Download the files needed for the latest version of jQuery & jQueryMobile,
   and save each file to PhoneGap's www directory:

   a. http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
   b. http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0/jquery.mobile-1.3.0.min.js
   c. http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0/jquery.mobile-1.3.0.min.css
	
3. Download the jQueryMobile zip file and extract the images directory from it
   into PhoneGap's www directory.
   
   www/images
   
   This is different than the img directory that is created by PhoneGap's
   getting started guide.

4. Download the latest release of DrupalGap (or clone the development snapshot)
   and extract its contents into PhoneGap's www directory so drupalgap.js is
   located here:

   www/drupalgap.js

   Download Links:
     https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tags
     https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap

   Note, the drupalgap index.html will overwrite the index.html provided
   by PhoneGap.

5. Open www/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
   www/app/settings.js
   
6. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

   'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org',

7. Run your new Android Application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website.
